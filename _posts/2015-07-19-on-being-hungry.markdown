This post isn't going to be about hunger in the usual sense of 'I need food to survive', but will be focused on the 
drive to "do more".
There was a time, and it wasn't that long ago, that I was happy to just continue doing what I had been doing day in day
out.
Same shit, different day.

So what changed?
I think that the change in my attitude towards my work life is strongly linked to the clarity of my work goals.
Previously I didn't know what I wanted to do or where I wanted to be, and with the absence of something to strive for,
effort, passion and motivation were hard to muster.
This presented itself in a number of ways, all of which culminated in me being someone that really didn't do much more
than was necessary.

I can now finally answer that question, with the confidence necessary for me to actually get there.
