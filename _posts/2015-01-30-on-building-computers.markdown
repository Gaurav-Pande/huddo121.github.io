I've built (and rebuilt) myself a number of PCs over the years, and there has always been some pre-destined purpose for
the machine.
Usually it's one of two things; a gaming rig or a home server.
Having a machine with an obvious goal makes it really easy to pick parts, as often I'm merely balancing price and
performance, however I've now started a build where my desired goal is less than concrete.

My next machine build is going to have a much stronger focus on the aesthetics of the entire setup (including
peripherals) than any of my previous builds.
This is something I have been thinking of doing for several months now, and it's finally coming time for me to start
trying to get all of the pieces together.
This has proven to be quite difficult.

Goals/Restrictions Of The Build:

* Stick to a white and orange colour theme as much as possible
* The machine must be suitable for both gaming and programming work
* The case must support at least 4 3.5" hard drives

It's the first restriction that has actually caused me all the difficulties I have experienced.
I am perfectly capable of picking decent parts for a new machine, but finding parts that either match my aesthetic
vision or could easily be modified to do so has often led to several nights in a row of hunting around for specific
SKUs.
It just seems that a white and orange colour scheme is just one of those things that PC parts manufacturers haven't
really considered very often, there just mustn't be the market for it.

So where does this leave me?
Well, I'm still hunting I guess, but at least I can find some joy in customising my mechanical keyboards to my hearts
content.
