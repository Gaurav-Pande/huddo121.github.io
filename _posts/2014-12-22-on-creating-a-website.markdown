Hi All,

As an attempt to broaden my technological horizons slightly I'm going to be chronicling all of my upcoming self-directed
learning in a blog format.
The first thing I'll be doing is building the website to allow me to have this dialogue.
This will also be an ongoing effort, and will likely be the subject of many of my posts in the forseeable future.
